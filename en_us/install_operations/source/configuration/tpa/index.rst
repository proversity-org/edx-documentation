Enabling Third Party Authentication
#######################################

To enhance sign in options for your users, you can enable third party
authentication, sometimes also called "third party auth", "single sign on", or
"SSO", between organizational authentication systems and the sites you define
for your implementation of the edX platform. After you enable third party
authentication, users can register and sign in to your Open edX site with their
campus or organizational credentials.
