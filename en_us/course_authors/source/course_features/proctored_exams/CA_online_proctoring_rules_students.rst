Online Proctoring Rules for Learners
####################################

EdX.org uses an online :ref:`proctoring<CA_ProctoredExams>` service for certain exams (typically final
exams) that are part of courses that can be made eligible for credit. Learners
taking proctored exams are required to adhere to a set of defined rules to
receive a **Satisfactory** result from the proctoring service.

If a particular exam in your course has less stringent rules or allows you to
use a specific tool such as a calculator or reference book during a proctored
exam, your course staff will let you know. If you are not told about any
different proctoring exam rules, make sure you adhere to the "Closed Book
Exam" rules that are described in the following sections.

Learners are responsible for testing their systems with the proctoring software
well in advance of all online proctored exams in their courses, so that any
troubleshooting that is required can be accomplished. Some courses include
practice proctored exams, so that learners can experience an example proctored
exam, including the software download and system check steps.

As with other ID-verified assessments and exams, learners will be asked to
establish their identity during the proctored exam process by supplying a photo
ID with a name that matches the full name they use in their edx.org account.

.. note:: Learners who require additional time or any specific accommodations
   or exemptions to the exam policies in order to complete a proctored exam,
   are asked to contact their course teams or edX Support. For information
   about handling special requests relating to proctored exams, see
   :ref:`Respond to Learner Concerns about Proctored Exams` and
   :ref:`specifying_exam_rules_and_exceptions`.
