Troubleshooting Situations that Learners Might Encounter
###########################################################

This section provides information about scenarios that learners might
encounter while they take proctored exams. In general, course teams will have
to decide how to proceed on a case by case basis. For more information, see
:ref:`CA_ProctoredExams_Overview` and :ref:`Managing Proctored Exams`.

***********************************************************
Navigating to Another Part of the Course During an Exam
***********************************************************

While they are taking a proctored exam, learners can navigate (using the same
browser session) to other parts of your course.

.. note:: It is a violation of edX's Online Proctoring Rules for learners to
   navigate to websites other than edX.org during the proctored exam.

If learners navigate to other parts of your course, they see an alert message
indicating that the timer on their exam continues to count down. When learners
return to the exam, they resume where they left the exam. The timer has been
continuing to count down during the learner's time away from the exam.


***************************************
Running Out Of Time In an Exam
***************************************

If the timer reaches 00.00 before a learner has completed the exam, the exam
ends, and all answers that the learner has submitted up to that point in time
are submitted for grading.

The proctoring software detects that the edX exam has ended, and prompts
learners to confirm that they want to quit their proctoring session. Learners
must go back to the proctoring software and confirm that they are quitting, so
that the proctoring session ends and the proctoring session data is uploaded
for review.


***********************************************************
Closing a Browser Window Before The End of the Exam
***********************************************************

Several situations might arise during the exam. This section describes the
result of each of these situations.

In some cases, course team members will have to decide whether the exam
results that were obtained are valid, or whether the exam attempt should be
cleared and the learner given an opportunity to retake the exam. For more
information, see :ref:`Requests for Retaking a Proctored Exam`.

===================================================
The Proctoring Software Terminates Unexpectedly
===================================================

If the proctoring software crashes, the LMS alerts learners and stops the
exam. Learners should contact edX Support in this situation.


===================================================
The edX Browser Terminates Unexpectedly
===================================================

If the browser in which the edX exam is running crashes, the exam timer for
each learner continues to run. Learners can reopen their exam in a new browser
window and continue their exam, but they will have lost time while the browser
was closed.

.. Question for Chris: how does the proctoring software view such a break in
.. taking the exam?


===================================================
Learners Close the Proctoring Software Window
===================================================

If learners close their proctoring software windows before they have completed
a proctored exam, they see alert messages warning them that they are ending
their exam. If they continue to close the proctoring software window, both the
exam and the proctoring session end.

The exam is stopped in the LMS. Answers in the exam up to the point that the
session ended are submitted for grading, but the proctoring session recording
might not be completely uploaded. Learners should contact edX Support in this
situation.


===========================================
Learners Close the edX Exam Window
===========================================

If learners close the browser in which their edX proctored exam is running
before they have completed the exam, they might not see any alerts, depending
on the browser that they are using. The exam  timer for each learner continues
to run. If learners reopen their exam in a new browser window, they can
continue their exam, but they will have lost time while the browser was
closed.
