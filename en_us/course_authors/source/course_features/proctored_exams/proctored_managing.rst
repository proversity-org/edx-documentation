Managing Proctored Exams

This section describes some tasks you will perform as you prepare and
administer proctored exams. For more information, see
:ref:`CA_ProctoredExams_Overview` and :ref:`Enabling Proctored Exams`.


.. _specifying_exam_rules_and_exceptions:

**************************************
Specifying Exam Rules and Exceptions
**************************************

The team of reviewers who examine the records of exam attempts determine whether
learners complied with the :ref:`Online Proctoring Rules
<CA Online Proctoring Rules>`. By default, the team of reviewers uses the
standard set of rules for taking proctored exams.

You can provide custom rules and rule exceptions if the content of an exam
requires them. If your course allows learners to use tools and techniques that
the default rules for proctored exams prohibit, you must provide information
about these rules and exceptions both to your learners and to the team of
reviewers.

To specify custom proctored exam rules and rule exceptions, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, open your course outline and select the subsection for the exam.

#. Select the **Configure** icon to open the **Settings** dialog box.

#. Select the **Advanced** tab.

#. In the **Review Rules**
   field, describe any additional rules or rule exceptions.

   Write clear, English-language descriptions of your exam rules. For example,
   you could enter the following rules.

   ``Allow one blank sheet of paper and a pencil or pen. Allow a hand-held
   calculator on the desk.``

#. Select **Save**.

.. note::
   Your description of the additional rules and rule exceptions must be as
   clear, specific, and easy to understand as possible. If the reviewers do not
   understand your rules and exceptions, they may incorrectly disqualify exam
   attempts. Use uncomplicated sentences and words that a global English-
   speaking audience will understand.

.. _Allow Opting Out of Proctored Exams:

*************************************************************
Allowing Verified Learners to Opt Out of Proctored Exams
*************************************************************

By default, verified learners can choose to take proctored exams without
online proctoring, and accept that they are no longer eligible for course
credit if they make this choice.

If you do not want to give verified learners in your course the choice of
taking proctored exams without proctoring, you can change a setting on the
**Advanced Settings** page in Studio.

==============================================================
Do Not Allow Verified Learners to Opt Out of Proctored Exams
==============================================================

To remove the option for verified learners to opt out of proctored exams in
your course, follow these steps.

#. In Studio, select **Settings**, then select **Advanced Settings**.

#. Locate the **Allow Opting Out of Proctored Exams** policy key. The default
   value is ``true``, which gives verified learners the option of taking
   proctored exams without proctoring.

#. Change the value of the setting to ``false``.

#. Select **Save Changes**.

After you enable this setting for your course, options for taking exams
without proctoring are no longer available to verified learners.

Responding to Learners' Concerns about Proctored Exams

In addition to questions that can be answered in the FAQs on edx.org, or by the
:ref:`online proctoring rules <CA Online Proctoring Rules>`, situations might
arise that require an action by edX Support.

.. _Requests for Additional Time:

===================================
Handle Requests for Additional Time
===================================

In some situations, for example to accommodate learners with disabilities,
additional time allowances can be provided for specific students. Consult with
your organization's Disability Services resources to decide whether and how a
learner with specific needs can be accommodated for a timed exam.

.. note:: Make sure the learner who has requested additional time does not
   start taking the proctored exam before the additional time has been approved
   and set up.

If it is confirmed that additional time should be allowed for a specific
student to take the exam, follow these steps.

#. Contact edX Support to ask them to set up a time allowance for the learner.

#. Provide edX Support with the learner's username or email address, and the
   amount of additional time that this learner should be allowed to complete
   the exam.

#. When the allowance has been set up, let the learner know their adjusted
   allowed time for the exam.

   When this learner starts taking the exam, the exam timer takes into account
   the adjusted time.


.. _Requests for Special Allowances:

=======================================
Handle Requests for Special Allowances
=======================================

In some situations, for example to accommodate learners with disabilities,
special allowances can be provided for specific students. Consult with your
organization's Disability Services resources to decide whether and how a
learner with specific needs can be accommodated.

.. note:: Make sure the learner who has requested special allowances does not
   start taking the proctored exam before the exemption has been approved and
   set up.

If it is confirmed that a special allowance should be made to the exam
policy for a particular learner, follow these steps.

#. Contact edX Support and ask the support team to set up a special allowance
   for the learner.

#. Provide edX Support with the learner's username or email address and the
   exception to the standard exam policy. For example, "Learner cannot
   see. Allow an additional person in the room to act as a scribe."

#. When the allowance has been set up, let the learner know that their special
   allowance has been granted.

   When the learner's proctored exam results are reviewed, the reviewer is
   aware of the special allowance and takes that into account.


.. _Requests for Retaking a Proctored Exam:

=====================================================
Handle Requests for Retaking a Proctored Exam
=====================================================

Course teams might have to assist learners who have experienced technical
difficulties with online proctoring, or have other reasons to request
permission to retake a proctored exam. Learners can contact edX support to
request that their proctored exam attempts be cleared. Clearing a proctored
exam attempt allows a learner to retake a proctored exam.

.. note:: Deleting a learner's exam attempt clears all submitted answers, and
   the learner experiences the exam as if for the first time, including making
   the choice to take the exam with online proctoring, obtaining an exam code,
   going through the proctoring software setup, and so on.

If a learner needs to retake a proctored exam, follow these steps.

#. Instruct the learner to contact edX Support and request that the support
   team delete the exam attempt.

#. When the exam attempt has been deleted, instruct the learner to
   retake the exam.
