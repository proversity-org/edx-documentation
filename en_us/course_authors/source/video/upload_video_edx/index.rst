  **This process applies only to courses that run on the edx.org site.** For
  information about adding video files to courses that run on Edge, see

Making course videos available to as many learners as possible can be a complex
undertaking.

* Videos need to be available from more than one host site to play in locations
  around the world.
* Videos need to be available in several different formats to play on
  desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, and other mobile devices.
* Videos need to be available for both download and streaming for learners with
  slow or intermittent internet connections.

To help course teams at partner institutions deliver high quality video
experiences to as many learners as possible, edX offers video processing
services. For each video, these services create additional file formats that
are transferred to the YouTube content management system (CMS) and Amazon Web
Services (AWS), and then associate all of these file formats with a single
video ID that the course team enters in a video component.

This section describes the steps to organize your team, upload video files to
Studio for encoding, and monitor the status of your course videos.
