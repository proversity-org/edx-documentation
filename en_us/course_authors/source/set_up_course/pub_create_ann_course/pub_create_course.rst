   page for the course.
#. :ref:`Edit the course <Pub Edit a Course>`, adding all required information
   for the About page on the page for the course.
#. :ref:`Send the course to the edX marketing team <Pub Send a Course for

     the course, leave this option blank.

#. Select **Create New Course**.

   If you did not select the **I want to add a run to this course at this

   at any time before you send the course to edX marketing for review. For more
   information, see :ref:`Pub Edit a Course`.

   make additional changes. Deletions are indicated in pink, and additions are
   indicated in green.

   * If you are satisfied with all of the changes, under **Revision History**,
     select **Accept All**.

   * If you want to reject all changes and return to an earlier version of the
     course, under **Revision History**, select the version that you want. You
     see that version together with indicators of the changes that have been

     field has changed, that field now has three buttons: **View Changes**,
     **Accept All**, and **Reject All**.

     #. To view the changes, select **View Changes**. A field opens to the left
        of the text editing field, showing the pink and green change
