Setting Up a Course
###################

When you begin to set up a course, the first step is to plan and specify two
types of basic information.

* **Course** information, such as the course title and number, remains true
  whether the course runs one time or multiple times.
* **Course run** information, such as the course staff and start date,
  can change every time the course runs.

When you are ready to create a course, you enter this information in
:ref:`edX Publisher <Introduction to Publisher>`. Publisher is a companion
to Studio. The information that you enter depends on your goal.

* **If your goal is to enter course content in Studio**, you enter a small
  amount of specific course and course run information in Publisher. EdX will
  then create a Studio URL for a course run, and you can add lessons and modify
  settings in Studio.

* **If your goal is to create a course About page**, you enter all required
  information in Publisher, as well as a limited amount of information in
  Studio. EdX then creates an About page for your course run and publishes the
  About page on edx.org.

  .. note::
   Before you enter any content or information in Studio, edX must create a
   Studio URL.

This section provides information about how to determine required course and
course run information, as well as how to enter this information into Publisher
and Studio.
