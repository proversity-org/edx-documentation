On the **Programs** tab of learners' dashboards, learners can now easily track
their progress towards program completion. Learners can use the new progress
ring to visualize their progress. They use the dashboard to track which
courses are in progress, completed, or remaining. Finally, they can retrieve
their course and program certificates from their program dashboard.

closed enrollment were not receiving their refunds automatically. Their
refunds will now be processed correctly if they are eligible for one.

In the LMS, the Course page now opens to a course outline that serves as the
basis for a new course home experience. This course outline replaces the
course outline sidebar on course content pages that listed sections and
subsections and allows learners to focus on content consumption and
progression through the course. For more information, see any of the following
sources. For more information, see `Update: Course Navigation Changes
