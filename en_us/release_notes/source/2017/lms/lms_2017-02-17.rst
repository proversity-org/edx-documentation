Special Exams
================================================

Learners who complete a proctored exam now receive emails to confirm their
exam submission as well as when proctoring review results are available. The
text in these emails is now more descriptive and helps learners understand
when their exams will be reviewed, and why they have passed or failed
proctoring (:jira:`TNL-6482`)

For special exams, the student exam attempts table and proctored exam report
now correctly assign the "finished at" column timestamp. Previously this
column made it seem like some learners were unfairly receiving more time to
complete their exam. (:jira:`TNL-6111`)

================================================
Open Response Assessments
================================================

Deadlines for open response assessments now correctly display in the learner's
time zone. (:jira:`TNL-6501`)
