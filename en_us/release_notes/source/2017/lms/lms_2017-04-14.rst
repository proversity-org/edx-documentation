An issue causing learners to see sections in the wrong order on the Progress
page has been fixed. (:jira:`TNL-6836`)

For newly created courses that use cohorts, inline discussion components are
no longer divided by cohort by default. By default, inline discussion
components are unified so that all learners can participate in the discussion.
You can still decide which inline discussion components are divided, and
specify this on the Cohorts tab in the instructor dashboard.
