Several accessibility improvements were made to discussions. To provide a better experience for screen reader users, only actual headings in discussions are now tagged as heading elements (TNL-6363). Fields that are required when learners add new posts now have asterisks next to their names as visual indicators of being required fields. Required fields were already indicated as such in screen reader attributes (TNL-6364).
