Drag and drop problems can now be rescored using the same process that CAPA
problems use. For more information, see :ref:`partnercoursestaff:rescore` in
*Building and Running an edX Course* or :ref:`opencoursestaff:rescore` in
*Building and Running an Open edX Course*. (:jira:`TNL-6765`)

On the **Cohorts** tab on the instructor dashboard, the count of learners
associated with the cohort reflects only active learners. Previously, this
count also reflected unenrolled learners.  (:jira:`TNL-6603`)

A problem that prevented learners from using the **Show Answer** option more
than one time has been resolved. (:jira:`TNL-6436`)
 
When learners select **Bookmarks** to view their bookmarks, the **Bookmarks**
view that opens now covers the whole page. Previously, the left pane that
lists course sections and subsections was visible when learners viewed
bookmarks. This change improves navigation for screen readers.

On the Programs page of learners' dashboards, each program card clearly
displays the number of courses completed, enrolled in, and remaining in the
program. (:jira:`ECOM-6601`)
