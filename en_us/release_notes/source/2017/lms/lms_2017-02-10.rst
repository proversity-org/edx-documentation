For screen reader users of the discussion forum, focus is now sent to the
correct place after a response/comment is added. (:jira:`TNL-6170`)

The post type options for a new discussion post now use standard radio button
visuals so that learners who use high contrast mode can identify which post type
is selected. (:jira:`TNL-6366`)

The course tools area used for Notes and Calculator is no longer announced to
screen readers when no tools are enabled. (:jira:`TNL-6349`)

The filter control in the wiki now has a visible field label. (:jira:`TNL-6440`)
