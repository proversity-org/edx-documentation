For a few weeks, discussion posts marked as anonymous would still expose the
post author's name. A fix was merged to prevent this from happening in the
future. Any posts that were intended to be anonymous authored between February
8 2017 and March 7 2017 will still show the author's username to other students.

We have extended the "view as a specific learner" functionality to the
progress page.  (:jira:`TNL-5047`)
