*****************************
Test Environment Requirements
*****************************

To pass a proctored exam, learners must make sure that the environment in
which they take the exam meets the following requirements.

=====================================
The Room You are Taking the Test In
=====================================

.. note:: Each time you take a proctored exam, you are asked to perform a
   webcam scan of the room that you want to take the exam in. You do not need
   to take all of your proctored exams in the same room, but you must take each
   exam in the room that you scanned for that exam.

#. Take the exam in the same room that you scanned during the proctoring setup
   for the current exam.

#. Do not move to another room during the exam. The exam must be started and
   completed in the same room.

#. Do not leave the room during the exam for any reason, unless you have been
   specifically permitted to do so in posted guidelines for a particular exam.

#. While you are taking the proctored exam, no other person is allowed to
   enter the room in which you are taking the exam.

#. Make sure the room is well lit. The lighting in the room must be bright
   enough to be considered "daylight" quality. Overhead lighting is preferred.
   If overhead lighting is not available, the source of light should not be
   behind you.

#. Sit at a clean desk or table, not on a bed or couch.

#. Clear the desk or table of all materials such as books, papers, notebooks,
   calculators, and so on, unless you have been specifically permitted (in
   posted guidelines) to have such materials available for a particular
   examination.

   In addition to pens, paper, calculators, textbooks, and notebooks, the
   following tools should not be on your desk or used during your proctored
   exam.

   * Phones.
   * Programs such as Excel, Word, Powerpoint.
   * Communication programs such as Skype.
   * Any website page other than the exam window in your course, including
     other content on edX.org.

#. Make sure there is no writing visible on the desk or on the walls around
   you.

#. Make sure you do not have more than one display or monitor connected to the
   computer on which you are taking the exam.

#. Do not have music or television playing in the background during the exam.

#. Do not use headphones, ear buds, or any other type of listening equipment.

#. Do not talk to anyone else. During the proctored exam you must not
   communicate with any other person by any means.

#. Do not use a phone for any reason during the proctored exam.


==========================================
The Computer You are Taking the Test With
==========================================

#. Make sure you do not have more than one display or monitor connected to the
   computer on which you are taking the exam. For example, if you usually use
   a laptop with a monitor connected, disconnect your monitor and use only the
   laptop screen.

#. Before starting your proctored exam, close all other programs or windows on
   your testing computer.

#. The following tools should not be used during your proctored exam.

   * Programs such as Excel, Word, Powerpoint.
   * Communication programs such as Skype.

#. Dress as if you are in a public setting.

#. Do not leave the room during the exam for any reason, unless you have been
   specifically permitted to do so in posted guidelines for a particular exam.

   completed in the same room.
