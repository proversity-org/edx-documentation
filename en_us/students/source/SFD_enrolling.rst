the course or program, including the course or program duration, the hours of
work that you should expect to spend each week, the institution that offers the

credit.

.. _Course Availability:

============================
When is a Course Available?
============================

Every course on edx.org has a status that tells you when it is available. When
you search for courses on edx.org, you can refine your search by availability.

.. note:: You can enroll in courses which have start dates in the future, but
   you cannot access course content or assignments before the start date.

.. image:: ../../shared/images/SFD_Search_RefineByAvailability.png
   :width: 200
   :alt: The course availability options under "Refine Your Search" on edx.org.

* **Current** - the course is in session now.
* **Starting Soon** - the course will start within 60 days.
* **Upcoming** - the course will start in more than 60 days.
* **Archived** - the course has ended. You can only enroll in the audit track of
  an archived course. Once enrolled, you can access course materials, but you
  cannot receive a grade. Some features, such as course discussions and
  assignments, might not be available.

Some courses are offered at multiple times during the year. Most edX courses
are repeated, but scheduling is up to the individual course team.

If a course that you want to take is offered at other times in the future, a
**More Dates** option is available above the current course's start date
information and **Enroll Now** button. Select **More Dates** to see other
times that the course is offered, and enroll in any of the available times.

and :ref:`course pacing<SFD Course Pacing>`.


.. _Enrollment Tracks:

===========================================
What Enrollment Tracks Does a Course Offer?
===========================================

Most edX courses offer a choice of enrollment tracks. You can choose to take
a course for free, without the option of earning a certificate, or you can
take a course for a fee, with the option of earning a verified certificate.

For more information about enrolling in a course, see :ref:`SFD Enroll in a
Course`.

.. _SFD About Audit Track:

About the Audit Track
*********************

Most courses offer an audit track. The audit track is free of charge, and does
not include a certificate when you complete your course. The audit track gives
you access to all course materials, including assignments and exams.

When you first enroll in a course, you are automatically enrolled in the audit
track.

If the course offers a verified track and the deadline for enrolling in
the verified track has not passed, you can choose to  upgrade to the verified
track. For more information, see :ref:`SFD Change to the Verified Track`.


.. _SFD Verified Track:

About the Verified Track
*************************

Many courses offer a verified track in addition to the free audit track. The
verified track has a fee, and offers a verified certificate when you pass the
course.

If a course has a verified track, you see a "Verified" indication on the
course image in the course catalog on edx.org.

.. image:: ../../shared/images/SFD_VerifiedBadge.png
   :width: 200
   :alt: Image of a course card with a verified indication.

When you enroll in or :ref:`upgrade to the verified track<SFD Change to the
Verified Track>` in the course, you submit payment, and, some time before the
verification deadline, you must :ref:`verify your identity<SFD Verify Your
Identity>` using a webcam and a photo ID.

.. note:: The fee for a verified certificate varies by course. The amount of
   the fee is listed on the About page for that course. The fee helps support
   edX's mission. If you are unable to pay the certificate fee, you can apply
   for financial assistance using the `financial assistance application`_.

For a list of all courses that currently offer verified certificates, see the
`edX course catalog`_. For more information about enrolling in the verified
track for a course, see :ref:`SFD Enroll in a Course` or :ref:`SFD Change to
